Great! These are the **feature columns** and the **target** from the dataset. Here’s what each of them represents:



MolLogP,   MolWt,     NumRotatableBonds,    AromaticProportion,    logS

### 🔬 **Molecular Descriptor Columns**

#### **1. MolLogP**

* **Meaning**: Logarithm of the octanol–water partition coefficient.
* **What it tells us**: Indicates **lipophilicity** — how soluble the molecule is in fats vs. water.
* **Interpretation**:

  * High LogP = more lipophilic (fat-loving)
  * Low LogP = more hydrophilic (water-loving)

#### **2. MolWt**

* **Meaning**: Molecular weight of the compound (in atomic mass units).
* **What it tells us**: Larger molecules typically have different solubility and permeability characteristics.

#### **3. NumRotatableBonds**

* **Meaning**: Number of bonds that can freely rotate.
* **What it tells us**: Indicates molecule **flexibility**. More flexibility can affect how a molecule interacts with biological targets and solvents.

#### **4. AromaticProportion**

* **Meaning**: Proportion of atoms in the molecule that are part of aromatic rings.
* **What it tells us**: Aromaticity influences **chemical stability**, **electronic properties**, and **solubility**.

### 🎯 **Target Variable**

#### **5. logS**

* **Meaning**: Logarithm (base 10) of aqueous solubility (mol/L).
* **What it tells us**:

  * Higher values = **more soluble** in water
  * Lower (more negative) values = **less soluble**
* This is the value you'd typically try to **predict** using the descriptors above.

Let me know if you'd like to build a model to predict `logS` or visualize any of these relationships!
