## Imagine house prices like a guessing game 🏠💰

You built a **price-guessing machine** for houses.

The machine looks at:

* how **big** the house is
* how many **bedrooms**
* how many **bathrooms**

Then it **guesses the price**.

---

## 1️⃣ What does R² = 0.51 mean?

Think of house prices as a big mystery puzzle 🧩

* Your model can explain **about half** of the puzzle
* **51%** is explained by your machine
* **49%** is stuff it doesn’t know yet (like neighborhood, view, age, upgrades)

### Why is this good?

* Your machine does **just as well on new houses** as old ones
* That means it’s **not cheating or memorizing**
* It’s actually learning patterns 👍

---

## 2️⃣ What are coefficients? (the rules your machine learned)

Each number tells the machine:

> “If this thing changes, how does the price change?”

---

### 🏠 Size of the house (sqft_living = +305)

If the house gets **1 square foot bigger**:

* Price goes **up about $305**

Bigger house → more money
This makes sense 😄

---

### 🛏 Bedrooms = **–56,000** (this looks weird at first!)

This does **NOT** mean bedrooms are bad.

It means:

* If the house size stays the same
* And you add more bedrooms
* Each bedroom makes rooms **smaller**

Smaller rooms = less comfy
So price can go **down**

Think:

> A pizza cut into more slices doesn’t give you more pizza 🍕

---

### 🚿 Bathrooms = +11,000

More bathrooms = easier life

* No waiting in line
* Guests are happy

So price goes **up a little** 👍

---

## 3️⃣ What is the intercept?

The intercept ($69,884) is just:

* the starting number before the machine adds anything

It’s like saying:

> “Let’s start counting from here.”

Not a real house — just math doing math.

---

## 4️⃣ What are the dots and the line on your graph?

### 🔵 Dots

* Real houses
* Their **real prices**

### 🔴 Line

* What the machine **predicts**

---

### If a dot is ON the line

🎯 Perfect guess!

### If a dot is ABOVE the line

* Real price is **higher** than predicted
* The machine guessed too low

### If a dot is BELOW the line

* Real price is **lower** than predicted
* The machine guessed too high

---

## 5️⃣ Are the dots above and below the line “errors”?

Yes — but **normal errors**, not bad ones.

Houses are weird:

* Some are remodeled
* Some have views
* Some are in fancy neighborhoods

Your machine can’t see everything yet.

That leftover mess is called:

* **error**
* **noise**
* **residuals**

All normal 👌

---

## 6️⃣ Big kid takeaway 🧠

Your model is basically saying:

> “I’m pretty good.
> I understand house prices about halfway.
> If you tell me more stuff, I can get smarter.”

And that’s **exactly** how real machine learning works.
